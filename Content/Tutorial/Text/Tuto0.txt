Welcome to The Shelter.
We provides perfect safety to customer.
However, we currently have ongoing issue.*********************
/Due to severe damage, this shelter's function is limited.
This shelter no longer provides long-time perfect protection from danger.
Calculating damage taken, shelter can sustain for 40days with extreme limitation of functions****/
During this period, functions in panic room will be active only. 
You need to find essential resources (food, water, electricity) in shelter from panic room to survive.
As Main gate function also broke down, you also need to be careful of monsters coming from outside.

Luckly, there's a way to solve current problem.
Materials to fix shelter is always saved in shelter and you just need to gather them to fix or evacuate from this shelter safely.

And there's a robot to help you gather resources from hazardous area.
When you click monitor, UI will pop up. Here, by clicking E and arrow, you can set the route for robot.
When set upt is done, press enter to send robot.

Beaware of location of monsters. If robot meets monster, it loses all resources it had, and immediately come back to panic room.
Staying alone in small room brings problem. Make sure to stay in good condition. Lack of resources will severly damage you safety and mentality.

Hope you a good luck!
